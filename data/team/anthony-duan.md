Anthony is a third-year in the College of Arts and Sciences who initially majored in Economics before taking COSC 051 and adding on Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. He is from Ellicott City, Maryland, and in his free time he likes listening to music, walking around the neighborhood, and hanging out with the Quizbowl and MUN teams! He is here to learn about machine learning.

## Work

Anthony is a member of our Machine Learning team, working with the rest of the team on a sentiment analysis model for the National Cherry Blossom Festival. Though he is new to GDT, he is excited to learn about this emerging field as one of the team's developers.
