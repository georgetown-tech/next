PK is a first-year student who calls New Canaan, Connecticut home. As someone with an international family with many people who work with innovative tech across many sectors, he has always been interested in how these two issues intersect and thus, as a student in the SFS, he is drawn to Georgetown Disruptive Tech. He learned to code in high-school and looks forward to building on his skills in innovative ways.

## Work

As part of the Developer team, PK is helping to modernize and digitize the Hoyaâ€™s online presence. He is looking forward to making sure we have a secure system and also ensuring its scalability so the team can work with college newspapers across the country.
